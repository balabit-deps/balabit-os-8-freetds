    Fix bulk insert multibyte string support in names

    When column name (or table name in blob type case) has non ASCII characters length of such string was calculated incorrectly.
    In such cases bulk insert has failed with:
    Msg 4804, Level 17, State 1
            While reading current row from host, a premature end-of-message was encountered--an incoming data stream was interrupted when the server expected to see more data. The host program may have terminated. Ensure that you are using a supported client application programming interface (API).
